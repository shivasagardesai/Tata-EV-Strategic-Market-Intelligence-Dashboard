# Tata-EV-Strategic-Market-Intelligence-Dashboard
This project is an advanced Power BI dashboard designed to provide strategic market intelligence on the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market. The dashboard is tailored for a market leader like Tata Motors Electric Mobility and aims to transform raw, publicly available data into actionable business insights.  

## Data Sources
The entire analysis is built using publicly available, open-source datasets sourced directly from the Government of India's National Data Portal (data.gov.in). This ensures the data is reliable, accurate, and transparent.

## The primary datasets used are:
    State-Wise EV Sales Data (2020-2023)
    State-Wise EV Charging Station Data
    State-Wise EV vs. Non-EV Vehicle Totals
