# Tata-EV-Strategic-Market-Intelligence-Dashboard
This project is an advanced Power BI dashboard designed to provide strategic market intelligence on the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market. The dashboard is tailored for a market leader like Tata Motors Electric Mobility and aims to transform raw, publicly available data into actionable business insights.
